just a kanban board for testing

needs an sql table to function, database schema in the attached xl file

open the spreadsheet then convert to csv then import into database

ONLY USE THE PROVIDED SQL FILE AS A TABLE TEMPLATE. 
The web-application is built to work based on a dynamic data stream so data MUST be inserted from the xlsx -> csv.
